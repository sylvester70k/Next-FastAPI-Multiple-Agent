    Make sure to include any entities like people, places, companies, products, things, etc in the learnings, as well as any exact metrics, numbers, or dates. The learnings will be used to research the topic further.
    The learnings should be in the following JSON Objectformat:
    {

            "learning1",
            "learning2",
